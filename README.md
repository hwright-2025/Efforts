|E1 | [Data Repository Finder](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E1_Data-Repository-Finder/blob/main/README.md) |Data Repository Finder helps NICHD researchers find data repositories where they can share data as they develop and implement their NIH Data Management and Sharing Plans. Repositories are added on an ongoing basis. |  <ul><li>[S3: As NICHD staff, I want to be able to update a given field in the Data Repository Finder and track the date and reason for the change, so that I can go back later and review why that decisions was made](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-3.md)</li></ul><ul><li> [S30: As an NICHD researcher, I want to find the best data repositories for the sharing scientific data that I am generating in my project and understand the repository 's submission and sharing practices so  I can complete my Data Management and Sharing Plan](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-30.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S31: As an NICHD program officer, I want to verify that researchers are using data repositories appropriate for the scientific data they plan to share and that their DMS Plan is consistent with the repository's expectations and requirements.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-31.md) </li></ul> |
|E2 | [Record Linkage Implementation Checklist](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E2_Record-Linkage-Implementation-Checklist/blob/main/README.md) |Resource for guiding governance and technical decisions that must be made prior to designing and implementing a strategy for linking data from multiple sources and sharing and using the linked datasets for research. |  <ul><li> [S41: As a researcher/clinician, I want to combine participant-level data collected from multiple studies and data repositories to merge multiple data types for each participant and avoid working with inflated sample sizes to effectively study COVID in children.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-41.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S42: As NIH staff, I want to fund research about the genetic underpinnings of COVID symptoms in children, but I want to avoid paying for duplicate whole genome sequencing for children who have already been sequenced in other studies.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-42.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S43: As an NIH data repository, I want to facilitate longitudinal data analysis of de-identified data from multiple studies to enable data users to study the impact of long COVID in children.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-43.md) </li></ul> |  |
